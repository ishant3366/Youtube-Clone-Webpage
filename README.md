# Youtube-Clone-Webpage
This project is a clone of the YouTube web page, built using HTML and CSS. The design aims to closely replicate the layout and user interface of YouTube. The page will be made fully responsive using CSS frameworks and JS,adapting to different screen sizes. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to refine the functionality and responsiveness!

Project Overview
The project is designed to mimic the structure and styling of the YouTube homepage, including essential components such as the navigation bar, video grid, side menu, and footer. It is a static web page that will eventually include responsive behavior to adapt to various screen sizes using CSS frameworks and JavaScript.

Key Elements Implemented:
1.Navigation Bar:

Contains buttons for Home, Trending, Subscriptions, and other YouTube features.
A search bar with a submit button that mimics the YouTube search functionality.
Icons for user interactions, such as the profile avatar, notifications, and upload buttons.

2.Buttons and Hyperlinks:

The page uses standard HTML buttons for interactions like Search and Login, styled using CSS for a modern look.
Hyperlinks are embedded to replicate YouTube’s navigation (e.g., clicking a video thumbnail would take you to the video page if it were dynamic).

3.Video Grid Layout:

The main section displays a grid of video thumbnails, titles, and view counts, laid out using CSS grid and flexbox for responsiveness.
Each video is wrapped in a clickable container that, when combined with JavaScript later, can link to a specific video page.

4.Side Menu:

A collapsible side menu similar to YouTube’s sidebar, providing links to categories like Trending, Subscriptions, and Library.
Uses CSS for hover effects and will later incorporate JavaScript for collapsing and expanding functionality.

Future Enhancements:
The current version of this project is a static clone built with basic HTML and CSS. However, it will be enhanced with several improvements:

1.Responsiveness:
The layout will be made fully responsive using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or TailwindCSS. This will ensure the page adjusts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) without breaking.

2.JavaScript Interactivity:
Dynamic Features: JavaScript will be introduced to handle dynamic elements such as video clicks, search functionality, and interactive components.
Responsive Sidebar: JavaScript will be used to create a fully functional collapsible side menu that adapts to mobile views.
